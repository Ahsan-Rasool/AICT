NOTEVERSE is a simple notes-sharing website developed as a university project.
It allows users to upload, share, browse, and search notes easily.
The website is built using HTML and CSS with a basic SQL database design (theoretical).
Canva was used to design the logo, banner, and promotional poster.
This project demonstrates basic web development, design, and documentation skills.
